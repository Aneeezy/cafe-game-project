# cafe game project
A a cozy café sim with a dark twist. You’ve just started a new job at a cute little café, and your boss seems great, kind, supportive, and always smiling. But when you mess up, that smile turns monstrous. Literally.  As the days go by and the pressure builds, you realize there’s only one way to survive: stop serving your boss… and start planning their downfall.
